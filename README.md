# Dentistimo Documentation

## Purpose
It is important to go to the Dentist for annual checkups and take good care of your teeth.
However, it's not always easy for newcomers in Sweden to get a dentist appointment as most clinics are already full and will reject you 
as a new care-taker. Consequently, they have to manually search online for available time-slots or get a hold of a clinic through 
tiring phone calls, with low success rates. Our project aims to develop a distributed system with a meaningful architecture while 
collaborating within a team in an agile manner during the development process.
